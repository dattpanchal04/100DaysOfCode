'''

What is Object Oriented Programming ?

- You know you are surrounded with objects. To represent this object in programming world means our main
task is we have to work with real world entities in programming. So, that is why object oriented
programming comes in.

What is Classes ?

- Class is a templates / blue prints of real world entities ( Objects )
- Class is a user defined data type.

What is objects ?

- Objects are specific instances of a class.

Constructor : Init method acts as a Constructor

Inheritance : With inheritance one class can derive the properties of anather class

Types of inheritance :
 1) Single Inheritance
 2) Multiple Inheritance
 3) Multi-level Inheritance : We have Parent, Child, grand-child relationship
 4) Hybrid Inheritance
